#   Tap into the game_data list, pick a random dictionary.
#   Get the "name", the "description" and the "country" of that dictionary
#   Display the "name", the "description" and the "country" of the dictionary in a single line.
#   Repeat for comparison B and save both data in a variable holding 'A' and 'B'.
#   ask for who has more followers#

# todo-2  After their input, display the higher lower logo again
#     if correct, print - you are right! print - current score: _

# execution
# Display the logo again.
# Check  if their answer is correct and print yes and their current score.
# Tap into the dictionary and get the follower_count, compare A and B and check with their answer.
# create a score function to keep track of the score.
# if they are wrong, quit the game. (Sorry, that's wrong. final score: _)
# todo-3   Then make the previous B become A and print the 'vs' logo again
#     print another comparison C from the list, make it B and ask again.
#     continues this way until they lose.
#     then, print - sorry that's wrong. print - Final score: _ and end the program.

# FAQ: Why does choice B always become choice A in every round, even when A had more followers?
#
# Suppose you just started the game, and you are comparing the followers of A - Instagram (364k) to
# B - Selena Gomez (174k). Instagram has more followers, so choice A is correct.
# However, the subsequent comparison should be between Selena Gomez (the new A) and someone else.
# The reason is that everything in our list has fewer followers than Instagram.
# If we were to keep Instagram as part of the comparison (as choice A) then Instagram would stay
# there for the rest of the game. This would be quite boring. By swapping choice B for A round,
# we avoid a situation where the number of followers of choice A keeps going up over the course of the game.
# Hope that makes sense :-)
